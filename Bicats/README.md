## Summary

This directory contains  basic information about (2,1)-categories and
pseudofunctors between them. It also contains a definition of a biequivalence
between (2,1)-categories. Finally, it defines a weak notion of univalence for
(2,1)-categories (called _quasi-univalence_) and shows that every biequivalence
between quasi-univalent bicategories is fully-faithful. This fact follows from
the general fact that every equivalence of wild categories is fully faithful,
which we prove in `../HoTT-Agda/`.
