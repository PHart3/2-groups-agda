## Summary

This directory contains basic information about bicategories, which for us always mean
(locally univalent) (2,1)-categories, and pseudofunctors between them, including a definition 
of global univalence for such categories, in terms of adjoint equivalences. It also contains a 
definition of a biequivalence between bicategories. Moreover, it defines a biadjoint biequivalence
between (globally) univalent bicategories as a biequivalence with one additional datum: the triangulator. 
We prove that a biadjoint biequivalence in this sense is fully coherent: being an adjoint equivalence is 
a mere property of a pseudofunctor and is equivalent to being an isomorphism (i.e., being fully faithful
and an equivalence on objects). Note that isomorphisms are equivalent to identities of bicategories by
the univalence axiom.
