## Summary

This directory contains basic information about (locally univalent) (2,1)-categories 
and pseudofunctors between them, including a definition of global univalence for
such categories, in terms of adjoint equivalences. It also contains a definition of 
a biequivalence between (2,1)-categories. Finally, it defines a weak notion of univalence 
for (2,1)-categories (called _quasi-univalence_) and shows that every biequivalence 
between quasi-univalent bicategories is fully-faithful. This fact follows from the 
general fact that every equivalence of wild categories is fully faithful, which we 
prove in `../HoTT-Agda/`.
