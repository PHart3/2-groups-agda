## Summary

This directory contains basic information about bicategories, which for us always mean
(locally univalent) (2,1)-categories, and pseudofunctors between them, including a definition 
of global univalence for such categories, in terms of adjoint equivalences. It also contains a 
definition of a biequivalence between bicategories. Moreover, it defines a biadjoint biequivalence
between bicategories as a biequivalence with one additional datum: the triangulator (or zig-zag identity). 
This notion resembles the well-known notion of half-adjoint equivalence between types. We prove that a 
biadjoint biequivalence in this sense between globally univalent bicategories is fully coherent: being an 
adjoint equivalence is a property of (rather than structure on) a pseudofunctor and is equivalent to being 
an isomorphism (i.e., being fully faithful and an equivalence on objects). Note that isomorphisms are equivalent 
to identities of bicategories by the univalence axiom.
