Outline of project:

(1) Construct a fully verified biequivalence between
      (a) the (2,1)-category of coherent 2-groups and
      (b) the (2,1)-category of 2-truncated connected pointed types.
(2) Sketch how this can be promoted to an equality via univalence.
    This requites a lot of unproblematic but complicated 2-categorical
    machinery that has not been ported to HoTT yet. Doing so is outside
    the main scope of this work.
