Outline of project:

(1) Construct a biequivalence between
      (a) the (2,1)-category of coherent 2-groups and
      (b) the (2,1)-category of 2-truncated connected pointed types.
(2) Show that this can be promoted to a biadjoint biequivalence.
(3) Show that this, in turn, can be promoted to an equality via univalence.

Steps (1) and (2) should be fully formalized. Step (3) will just be a pen-and-paper proof.
