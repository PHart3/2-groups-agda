## Overview

- We construct a fully verified biequivalence between
    1. the (2,1)-category of coherent 2-groups
    2. the (2,1)-category of 2-truncated connected pointed types.
    
  We also derive a verified equality between them by way of univalence.

  A preprint outlining our mechanization is located [here](https://phart3.github.io/2Grp-biequiv-preprint.pdf).

- We mechanize Owen Milner's equivalence between the type of *n*-groups (i.e., pointed connected *n*-types) and
  that of Sính triples (where *n* > 1).

The code has been checked with Agda 2.6.4.3. 

## Organization

The library has three main components, each component depending on the previous ones. It also has a fourth component
collecting the main theorems.

- `HoTT-Agda/`

  A stripped down version of Andrew Swan's [HoTT-Agda](https://github.com/awswan/HoTT-Agda/tree/agda-2.6.1-compatible) branch,
  with many changes and additions motivated by our construction
  of the biequivalence and by Milner's equivalence.

  See `HoTT-Agda/README.md` for details and for the license of the work inside this directory.

- `Bicats/`

  A collection of basic notions and facts about (2,1)-categories, which we also call bicategories in this work.

  See `Bicats/README.md` for details and for the license of the work inside this directory.

- `Two-groups/`

  Our formalization of the biequivalence and the induced equality.

  See `Two-groups/README.md` for details and for the license of the work inside this directory.

- `Sinh/`

  Our formalization of Owen Milner's proof of equivalence between pointed connected *n*-types (*n* > 1) and Sính triples.

  See `Sinh/README.md` for details and for the license of the work inside this directory.

- `Final/`

  A single file containing the final biequivalence and equality, Milner's equivalence, and the composite type equivalence
  between pointed connected 2-types and Sính triples.

  See `Final/README.md` for details and for the license of the work inside this directory.

## Type-checking

We have successfully tested the following Docker container on Linux with 16 GB of RAM and
100 GB of swap space.

1. Build Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build . -t 2group
   ```

   Our machine uses as much as 28.7 GB of physical memory and takes about 8 hours to build the image. 

2. Generate HTML files:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./html
   docker run --mount type=bind,source=./html,target=/Two-groups/html 2group
   ```

   This may take a few minutes. The HTML files will be under `html/`, and
   `html/Final-thms.agda.html` will be the entry point.

If you can avoid the overhead of Docker, we suggest that you do so even if you
have lots of available RAM.

We have found that type-checking directly on a MacOS with an M1 chip is much
faster (see `Final/README.md`).

**Important:** Comment out the final two imports in `Final/Final-thms` to reduce the type-checking by more than half. Doing so will check
all relevant type equivalences but not the biequivalence.
