## Manual Type-Checking

1. Install Agda 2.6.4.3.
2. Add all lib files in the repo to your Agda libraries file. 
3. Type-check the file `Final-thms.agda`.

The type-checking of this file is arduous. We have verified that the type-checker
finishes successfully on the following machine:

*macOS Sequoia 15.4.1, Apple M1 chip, 16 GB of RAM*

The type-checking takes about 165.7 minutes in total (see [stats.md](stats.md)).
Note that macOS, unlike Linux, dynamically alters the size of the swap
space as the process runs. This is crucial because the type-checking uses
as much as 29 GB of physical memory. Therefore, you will need to increase
your machine's swap space if you have under 29 GB of available RAM.

**Important:** Comment out the final two imports in `Final-thms` to reduce the type-checking by over an hour. Doing so will check
all relevant type equivalences but not the biequivalence.
