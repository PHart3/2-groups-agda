## Summary

This directory contains a mechanization of Owen Milner's type equivalence between (*n*+2)-groups
(i.e., pointed connected (*n*+2)-types) and Sính triples at level *n + 1*, with *n* non-negative.

For *n* non-negative, a *Sính triple (at level *n*)* consists of an *n*-group BG, a G-module H : BG -> Ab, 
and a cocycle in H^(*n*+2)(G, H).
We also obtain a set-truncated version of the equivalence, between components of *n*-groups and components of triples
consisting of an *n*-group BG, a G-module H : BG -> Ab, and a cohomology class in H^(*n*+2)(G, H).

This directory also contains a proof that the action of the Sính triple for a given *n*-group BG (where n ≥ 2) is 
the canonical action of the fundamental n-group π₁ⁿ(BG) on the abelian group πₙ(BG).
